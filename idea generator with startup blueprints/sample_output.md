Startup Idea: GreenLearn
Pitch: A SaaS platform offering gamified sustainability courses for Kenyan schools.
Problem: Lack of engaging, localized environmental education in Kenyan secondary schools.
Target Market: Kenyan secondary schools, eco-conscious parents, and community organizations.
MVP: A web application with 5 interactive courses on sustainability, including quizzes and virtual simulations.
Monetization: Subscription-based model for schools ($100/year/school), freemium access for parents.
Competitive Edge: Culturally relevant content tailored to Kenyan contexts, gamified learning for high engagement.
Validation Steps:

Conduct surveys with 20 schools to assess demand.
Pilot the platform with 3 schools for 3 months.
Collect feedback via user testing and iterate on content.

Tech Stack: Python (Django), PostgreSQL, JavaScript (React), AWS hosting.
