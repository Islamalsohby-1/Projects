In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists at the European Space Agency have confirmed the presence of liquid water beneath the icy surface of Mars. The finding, published in the journal Science, was made using data from the Mars Express spacecraft, which has been orbiting the planet since 2003. The water, found in a lake about 20 kilometers wide, is located beneath the south pole of Mars. Researchers believe this could indicate the possibility of microbial life, as water is a key ingredient for life as we know it. The discovery has sparked excitement in the scientific community, with plans for future missions to explore this subsurface lake further. However, challenges remain, as drilling through the thick ice to reach the water will require advanced technology. The team emphasized that this finding does not yet confirm life on Mars but significantly increases the chances of finding it. Additional data suggests the lake contains salts, which could keep the water liquid at sub-zero temperatures.
